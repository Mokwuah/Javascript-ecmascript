comparison operators

==  loose comparison operator(compares two values but ignores data-type, e.g 7 == "7" would be true, 
    it works by coercing the operands to match the data type.)

=== strict equality operator (checks whether the operands and types are equal basically, e.g "1" === 1 is false)

!=  loose not equal to

!== strict not equal to

<   less than

>   greater than

<=  less than or equal to

>=  greater than or equal to

&&  and 

||  or

!   not

the continue keyword is a skip

the break keyword is a stop
