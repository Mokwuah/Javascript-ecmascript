comparison operators

==  loose comparison operator(compares two values but ignores data-type, e.g 7 == "7" would be true, 
    it works by coercing the operands to match the data type.)

=== strict equality operator (checks whether the operands and types are equal basically, e.g "1" === 1 is false)

!=  loose not equal to

!== strict not equal to

<   less than

>   greater than

<=  less than or equal to

>=  greater than or equal to

&&  and 

||  or

!   not

the continue keyword is a skip(Once encountered, it skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. In other words, it stops executing the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and jumps to the next iteration or the beginning of the loop.)
the break keyword is a stop
